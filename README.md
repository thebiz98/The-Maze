# The-Maze
This contains a fun game for solving three given mazes. The positions of the blocks and path are hardcoded, and can be changed by playing around with the source code. It is a simple implementation of the concept with no dedicated graphics implementation. The graphics implemented are rudimentary and use simple characters. 

The game needs the player to enter the coordinates it wants to move the pointer to. The starting point is marked as 'HOME' and the end point is marked as 'END'. The player has to navigate the maze by entering the appropriate coordinates. The challenge is to remain patient and enter the right coordinates, as you need to count the coordinates agian and again.

The program is meant to be run on the BlueJ IDE. A C++ implementation of the program will be uploaded soon. Also, a command line version of the java program will also be included.
